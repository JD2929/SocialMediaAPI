Designing routes for Social Media platform - backend only 

## Using

Due to the fact that the code is only for the backend seeing the routes in action is not like using a typical app. 

In your terminal, you will need to start the server. 

type: npm start 

Once this is running, you must go to Insomnia (or some other app that allows you to use/test backend routes) and work through each. 

Remember that when searching for a specific user, or joining friends you must copy and paste their use id's into the route!
